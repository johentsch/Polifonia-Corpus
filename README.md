# Polifonia Corpus

### The Polifonia Multilingual Corpus

This repository contains the metadata of the Polifonia Multilingual Corpus.

The general corpus (wikipedia) was created selecting from **[BabelNet domains](http://lcl.uniroma1.it/babeldomains/)** all the **[Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org)** musical pages in English (EN), French (FR), Italian (IT) and Spanish (ES). The metadata can be downloaded from **[here](https://liveunibo.sharepoint.com/:u:/s/polifonia/EXGiP3Co731FtKjpZuJM2y4BDr-N36FVk0FepC0-zgsY1Q?e=M5kRyY)** (77 MB).

The specialistic corpus was created selecting from different digital libraries (**[BNF](https://gallica.bnf.fr)**, **[BNE](http://www.bne.es)**) documents related to music. In particular, we selected documents that contain at least one of the terms in the **[Polifonia Lexicon](https://github.com/polifonia-project/Polifonia-Lexicon)**.
